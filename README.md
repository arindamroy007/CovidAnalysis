# CovidAnalysis
This is an online project titled "Visualizing COVID-19" done under the guidance of Richie Cotton, Curriculum Architect at DataCamp.
This project is done in R using Jupyter Notebook.
In this project, I visualised the data from the early months of the coronavirus outbreak to see how this virus grew to be a global pandemic.
I have used readr, dplyr and ggplot2 libraries in this project.
